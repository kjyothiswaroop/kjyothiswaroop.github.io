project_title: Detect, Predict, and Catch:Vision-Based Ball Interception with a Robotic Arm
---

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview
This project develops a **vision-based object detection and interception system** using a **Franka Emika Panda robotic arm**.An external camera tracks a moving ball in real time, while a trajectory prediction module estimates its future position and guides the robot to intercept and catch the ball. The system integrates perception, prediction, and control to enable autonomous, dynamic manipulation.
